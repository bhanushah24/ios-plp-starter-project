## Reason for incomplete status of badges

I was able to fetch the user offers and format offer string but in order to display the badge we needed the priority order where I did not clearly understood how to prioritise the string. According to instructions, Split the string on "||" to get available badges in priority order. So amongst the "available_badges", do we say "loyalty:SLOTTED,BONUS||sale:PRIORITY_ACCESS,REDUCED"
First priority is for  loyalty > sale
